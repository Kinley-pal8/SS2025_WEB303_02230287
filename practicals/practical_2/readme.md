### 2.2 Component Architecture

#### API Gateway Layer
- **Function:** Single entry point for all external requests
- **Responsibilities:** Request routing, service discovery, load balancing, request/response transformation
- **Technology:** Go with standard HTTP libraries and Consul API client
- **Port:** 8080 (externally accessible)

#### Service Discovery Layer  
- **Function:** Centralized service registry and health monitoring
- **Technology:** HashiCorp Consul in development mode
- **Features:** Service registration, health checking, service lookup API
- **Port:** 8500 (management UI and API)

#### Microservices Layer
- **Users Service:** Manages user-related operations on port 8081
- **Products Service:** Handles product-related operations on port 8082
- **Common Features:** Self-registration, health endpoints, independent deployment

### 2.3 Communication Patterns

#### Service Registration Flow
1. Service starts and initializes HTTP server
2. Service registers itself with Consul including health check endpoint
3. Consul begins periodic health monitoring (10-second intervals)
4. Service becomes discoverable by API Gateway

#### Request Routing Flow
1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. Gateway extracts service identifier from URL path
3. Gateway queries Consul for healthy service instances
4. Gateway creates reverse proxy to selected service instance
5. Request forwarded to target service with path rewriting
6. Response returned through Gateway to client

### 3.2 Service Implementation Strategy

#### Users Service Architecture
The Users Service implements a standard HTTP REST pattern with the following components:

**Core Functionality:**
- RESTful endpoint: `GET /users/{id}`
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health`
- Consul registration with unique service instance ID
- Automatic health monitoring configuration

**Key Implementation Features:**
```go
// Service constants
const serviceName = "users-service"
const servicePort = 8081

// Consul registration with health checks
registration := &consulapi.AgentServiceRegistration{
    ID:      fmt.Sprintf("%s-%s", serviceName, hostname),
    Name:    serviceName,
    Port:    servicePort,
    Address: hostname,
    Check: &consulapi.AgentServiceCheck{
        HTTP:     fmt.Sprintf("http://%s:%d/health", hostname, servicePort),
        Interval: "10s",
        Timeout:  "1s",
    },
}
```

#### Products Service Architecture  
The Products Service follows an identical pattern to Users Service with differentiated:
- Service name: `products-service`
- Port allocation: 8082
- Endpoint pattern: `GET /products/{id}`
- Independent module and dependency management

This design demonstrates the reusable nature of microservices patterns and the ease of horizontal scaling.

#### API Gateway Implementation
The Gateway implements dynamic service discovery and request routing:

**Routing Logic:**
- URL pattern matching: `/api/{service}/{resource}`
- Service name extraction and transformation
- Dynamic Consul service lookup
- Reverse proxy creation and request forwarding

**Service Discovery Integration:**
```go
// Dynamic service discovery
func discoverService(name string) (*url.URL, error) {
    services, _, err := consul.Health().Service(name, "", true, nil)
    if len(services) == 0 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("no healthy instances found")
    }
    // Load balancing: select first healthy instance
    service := services[0].Service
    return url.Parse(fmt.Sprintf("http://%s:%d", service.Address, service.Port))
}
```

### 3.3 Service Discovery and Health Monitoring

#### Consul Configuration
- **Deployment Mode:** Development mode for simplified setup
- **Health Check Frequency:** 10-second intervals with 1-second timeout
- **Service Registration:** Automatic on service startup
- **Health Endpoints:** `/health` on each service

#### Health Check Implementation
Each service exposes a standardized health endpoint:
```go
func healthCheckHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Service is healthy")
}
```

This enables Consul to continuously monitor service availability and automatically update the service registry when instances become unhealthy.

- Both services visible with healthy status indicators
- Health check intervals functioning correctly

### 4.2 Functional Testing Results

#### Endpoint Testing via cURL

**Users Service Test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/123
# Expected: "Response from 'users-service': Details for user 123"
# Actual: Successfully routed and responded
```

**Products Service Test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products/abc  
# Expected: "Response from 'products-service': Details for product abc"
# Actual: Successfully routed and responded
```

#### API Gateway Routing Logs
Gateway terminal output confirmed:
- Request reception and path parsing
- Successful service discovery via Consul
- Correct URL rewriting and request forwarding
- Response relay to client

### 4.3 Resilience and Fault Tolerance Testing

#### Service Failure Simulation
**Test Procedure:**
1. Stopped Users Service (Ctrl+C)
2. Monitored Consul UI for health status change (≈10 seconds)
3. Attempted request to Users Service via Gateway
4. Verified Products Service continued operation
5. Restarted Users Service
6. Confirmed automatic re-registration and recovery

**Results:**
- Health checks correctly identified failed service
- Gateway returned appropriate error for unavailable service
- Other services remained unaffected
- Service recovery was automatic and seamless
- No manual reconfiguration required
